Learning about transfer learning and the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provided valuable insights into modern deep learning techniques. CNNs, with their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from image data, have become the foundation for many computer vision tasks. Understanding the structure of CNNs—composed of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers—highlighted their efficiency in handling complex visual patterns.

Transfer learning, on the other hand, allows leveraging pre-trained models to solve new tasks with limited data, which is highly beneficial when computational resources or data are constrained. This concept made me realize how deep learning models can be fine-tuned for specific applications, reducing training time and improving performance. Overall, these concepts have broadened my understanding of how advanced models are built and applied efficiently in real-world scenarios.
