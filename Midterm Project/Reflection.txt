Building an object detection model proved to be more challenging than anticipated, primarily due to my limited coding knowledge and lack of sufficient computational power. While I understood the core concepts of object detection, translating that understanding into code was difficult, especially when dealing with complex frameworks and libraries. Debugging and optimizing the model required a deeper level of coding expertise that I had yet to fully develop.

Moreover, the limited computational power posed significant hurdles, especially when working with large datasets and training deep learning models. The processing time was slower than expected, and frequent crashes or delays in training further hindered progress. This made experimentation and fine-tuning hyperparameters a time-consuming process.

Despite these challenges, I gained valuable experience in problem-solving and resilience. I learned how important it is to optimize code for efficiency and explore alternative approaches when computational resources are limited. Although the project wasn't as successful as I'd hoped, it provided crucial insights into the difficulties faced in real-world machine learning tasks and motivated me to improve my coding skills and seek more efficient solutions in the future.
