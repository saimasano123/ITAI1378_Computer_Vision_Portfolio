This group project provided an excellent opportunity to explore and apply image enhancement techniques in a collaborative setting. Our primary task was to create a series of before-and-after images that visually demonstrated the effects of various image enhancement methods. This required us to work closely as a team to select appropriate techniques, such as contrast adjustment, sharpening, noise reduction, and color correction, and implement them effectively.

Collaboration was a key aspect of this project. One of the challenges we encountered was aligning our schedules to ensure consistent progress, which we overcame by setting clear deadlines and dividing tasks based on individual strengths. Additionally, debugging and fine-tuning some of the techniques took longer than expected, but perseverance and effective communication within the team allowed us to resolve these issues. Overall, this project was both engaging and educational.
