ITAI1378_Computer_Vision_Course
This portfolio showcases my work throughout the course, organized in a GitHub repository. Each module and its corresponding lab are included to demonstrate my understanding and application of key concepts in AI and machine learning. From neural networks and CNNs to reinforcement learning and GANs, the repository highlights both theoretical and hands-on learning experiences. It serves as a comprehensive record of the various techniques and algorithms explored, along with the challenges faced and insights gained during each lab. This portfolio reflects my growth in coding, problem-solving, and applying AI principles to real-world tasks.
In this course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of various AI concepts and techniques. I learned the fundamentals of neural networks and CNNs, exploring their applications in image classification and object detection, where I realized the importance of data quality, model tuning, and computational resources. The hands-on experience with building an AI agent to play Flappy Bird deepened my knowledge of reinforcement learning and highlighted the importance of coding in applying RL concepts. Additionally, exploring GANs in computer vision expanded my understanding of how generative models can be used to enhance technologies like self-driving cars. Overall, the course provided valuable insights into AI and machine learning, emphasizing the need for practical coding skills, computational power, and iterative experimentation to successfully implement and refine AI models.
