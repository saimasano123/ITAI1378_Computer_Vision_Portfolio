The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is a powerful supervised learning method that identifies the optimal hyperplane to classify data. In the context of image classification, it excels in distinguishing between classes by leveraging kernel functions to handle non-linear separations. During this project, I learning about different terminology of SVM, we used CIFAR-10 data set. this data set have 600 images for each of the ten classes. I learned about hyperplane, precision, recall and F1-Score. It help me understand that computer changes each image to greyscale inorder image her properly.
