The object detection lab was a valuable learning experience, but it highlighted the challenges involved in accurately detecting and classifying objects in images. Despite applying various algorithms and tuning parameters, the results were not as accurate as expected. One of the main issues was the misidentification or incomplete detection of objects, which likely stemmed from insufficient training data or limitations in the model's architecture.

This experience taught me the importance of dataset quality, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning in achieving accurate object detection. While the lab didn't provide perfect results, it emphasized the need for continuous refinement, good computational power, and validation of models. The challenges faced also deepened my understanding of the complexity involved in real-world computer vision tasks and how even small improvements in data and model design can significantly enhance performance.

Adapting our image classification task to an object detection task was an insightful shift in focus. Unlike classification, where the goal is to assign a label to the entire image, object detection requires identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image, often involving bounding boxes and class labels. This transition introduced new challenges, such as managing the complexity of detecting various objects in different positions, sizes, and orientations.

During this adaptation, I learned the importance of using specialized algorithms like YOLO or Faster R-CNN, which are designed to handle object localization alongside classification. The task also emphasized the significance of annotation accuracy and dataset diversity to train models effectively. Although we encountered difficulties, such as achieving precise localization and reducing false positives, the process provided a deeper understanding of the additional layers of complexity in object detection compared to classification. Ultimately, this adaptation improved my understanding of how image classification can evolve into more advanced tasks in computer vision.
