This lab was an engaging introduction to the challenges of image classification, particularly distinguishing between visually similar objects like chihuahuas and muffins. By working through the dataset, I learned how to preprocess images, extract meaningful features, and apply machine learning algorithms for classification. The task highlighted the importance of using robust features and fine-tuning the model to handle subtle differences.

One challenge was ensuring the model could generalize well, as overfitting occurred during early iterations. I addressed this by augmenting the dataset and adjusting hyperparameters. The lab also underscored the value of visualization techniques in understanding the model's decisions. Overall, this experience enhanced my understanding of image classification and the intricacies involved in creating reliable models for real-world applications.

The group assignment provided an excellent introduction to the fundamentals of neural networks and their behavior through hands-on experimentation using TensorFlow Playground. By adjusting various parameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons, activation functions, and learning rates, I gained a deeper understanding of how these factors influence a network's performance.
It was fascinating to observe how increasing the complexity of the network improved its ability to model non-linear data, while also requiring careful regularization to prevent overfitting.
