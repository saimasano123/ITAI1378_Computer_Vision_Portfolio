This lab introduced me to critical tools and workflows for modern programming and collaboration. I gained a deeper understanding of version control using GitHub, particularly how repositories facilitate organized project management and collaborative work. Working with Jupyter Notebooks was equally valuable, as it demonstrated the efficiency of an interactive computing environment for coding, documentation, and visualization in one platform.

One challenge I faced was understanding the Git workflow, especially when staging, committing, and pushing changes to the repository. However, by consulting online resources and practicing the commands repeatedly, I overcame this difficulty. Additionally, navigating Jupyter's interface for the first time was slightly overwhelming, but experimenting with its features helped me build confidence. Overall, this lab was a meaningful step in developing practical skills for programming, version control, and interactive computing.
